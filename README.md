# Additional features
Once the extension is loaded, the user can browse through the Internet as they please and whevener they want to see the current graph of their browsing, they can click the extension icon on the top right corner. This will present the browse history as an interactive graph, where the nodes correspond to the web pages and the edges represent hyperlinks followed from one page to another. The currently viewable graph belongs to the current browse session. At any time the user has the option to start a new session (empty the graph and start from scratch). They may also export the current session at any time to import back at a later time (or exchange with a friend).

When the extension icon is clicked, by default the Willow extension window will be opened in a new dedicated tab. The user may also choose to view Willow on a side panel. This side panel is movable and resizable.

The user can revisit a desired web page by double-clicking on the associated node (or restore any previous session and visit the desired webpage from that session). 

## Discover web site map
Willow also provides a tool to crawl a particular URL and find all webpages underneath the given page. Willow also displays the number of broken links on a particular page, if any. This feature should be especially useful for web site developers as they can clearly see the navigation patterns from the home page to others as well as any broken links.

## Keyword search
The user may also search a keyword using the Search tool availble in the toolbar. The nodes whose URL or title contain the keyword will be highlighted as a result.

## Node annotations
- The *green arrow* on the upper left of a node indicates the current active page in a tab. So, if multiple tabs are opened after the session started, there might be multiple such pages (one per tab).

- The *note* icon on the lower right of a node indicates that a note has been added to the web page associated with this node.
